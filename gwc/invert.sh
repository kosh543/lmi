# MST files are so easy to edit that end users might be tempted to
# customize them, which might impair regulatory compliance. That
# temptation is removed by distributing only obfuscated copies.
# This script, for maintainer use only, deobfuscates and reobfuscates
# them in place.
#
# Mapping 255..0 to 0..255 is XORing with 0xFF.

# This script requires zsh because brace expansion is more convenient
# than 'seq', and especially because zsh offers glob qualifiers.
# shellcheck disable=SC1036,SC2039
