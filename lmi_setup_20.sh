# For now at least, ignore this warning:
#   dpkg-divert: warning: diverting file '/usr/bin/ischroot' from an Essential
#   package with rename is dangerous, use --no-rename
# because the debian.org wiki cited above still recommends this diversion
# as of 2019-03, and the underlying defect is still unresolved:
#   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=685034

# Suppress a nuisance: debian-based distributions provide a default
# bash logout file that clears the screen.
sed -e'/^[^#]/s/^/# SUPPRESSED # /' -i /etc/skel/.bash_logout

# This being a "plain" schroot, mount essential directories:
mount -t devpts -o rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,mode=600 devpts /dev/pts
mount -t proc -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime proc /proc

# If the chroot is to be permanent, consider adding those mounts to /etc/fstab:
#
# devpts /srv/chroot/${CHRTNAME}/dev/pts devpts rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,mode=600,ptmxmode=000 0 0
# proc /srv/chroot/${CHRTNAME}/proc proc rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0
#
# If the chroot is ever to be eradicated, use 'lmi_destroy_chroot.sh',
# which, crucially, unmounts before removing.
#
# As an alternative, configure the chroot with "type=directory"
# instead of "type=plain", so that 'schroot' mounts the appropriate
# filesystems when the chroot is entered, and unmounts them when it
# is exited. Then problems like this:
#   https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2019-09/msg00026.html
# would be prevented. However, it would be necessary to adapt all of
# the setup scripts, to avoid undesirable side effects as discussed
# here:
#   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2016-09/msg00014.html
# Adding a line like
#   setup.fstab=minimal/fstab
# to a 'plain' chroot's configuration file has no effect (and elicits
# no diagnostic).
#
# See also:
#   https://linux.die.net/man/7/schroot-faq
# | Should I use the plain or directory chroot type? [...]
# | plain is very simple and does not perform any setup tasks [...]
# | directory chroots do run setup scripts, which can mount additional
# | filesystems and do other setup tasks
#
# If a 'directory' chroot is to be configured, bind mounts may not be
# shown clearly in /etc/mtab ; use 'findmnt' to see them.

# Historical notes on various distros' package names.
#
# redhat names some packages differently:
#   pkgconfig ShellCheck libxml2 libxslt
#   vim-X11 vim-common vim-enhanced vim-minimal
#   mingw32-gcc-c++ mingw64-gcc-c++
#   java-1.8.0-openjdk
# It provides 'xsltproc' as part of libxslt, though not as a
# separate package:
#   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=965996
#
# Instead of worrying about such gratuitous differences, this suite
# of scripts installs a debian chroot on any host system, and builds
# only in that chroot.
