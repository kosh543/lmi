PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT TAX DISCLOSURE
<br>
The initial 7-pay premium limit is ${{InitSevenPayPrem}}.
As illustrated, this contract
{{#IsMec}}
    fails
{{/IsMec}}
{{^IsMec}}
    passes
{{/IsMec}}
the seven-pay test defined in Section 7702A
of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore
{{#IsMec}}
    {{^MecYearIs0}}
        becomes a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) in policy year
        {{MecYearPlus1}}.
    {{/MecYearIs0}}
    {{#MecYearIs0}}
        is a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).
    {{/MecYearIs0}}
    As a MEC, any loans or withdrawals are taxed to the extent
    of any gain in the contract, and an additional 10% penalty
    tax will apply to the taxable portion of the loan
    or withdrawal.
{{/IsMec}}
{{^IsMec}}
    is not a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).
    Subsequent changes in the contract, including but not limited
    to increases and decreases in premiums or benefits, may cause
    the contract to be retested and may result in the contract
    becoming a MEC.
