This example illustrates the addition of expression template
capabilities to a user-defined class.
See the tutorial in html/tut-1.html for a description of this example.

Vec3.h defines a simple vector class that contains 3 elements.
Unlike the STL example in examples/Vector, we can add an assignment
operator to this class that recognizes PETE expressions.  Therefore
this example doesn't tell the MakeOperators tool to generate
assignment operators that would call the evaluate() function.
