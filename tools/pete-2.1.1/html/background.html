<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>Object-oriented languages like C++ make development easier, but
performance tuning harder.  The same abstractions that allow
programmers to express their ideas compactly also make it hard for
compilers to re-order operations, predict how many times a loop will
be executed, or re-use memory instead of copying values.

<p>For example, suppose that a program uses a <tt>Vector</tt>
class to represent vectors of floating-point values:

<blockquote><pre>
class Vector
{
  public :
    Vector();                           // <em>default constructor</em>

    Vector(                             // <em>value constructor</em>
        int size,                       // <em>..size of vector</em>
        float val                       // <em>..initial element value</em>
    );

    Vector(                             // <em>copy constructor</em>
        const Vector &amp; v                // <em>..what to copy</em>
    );

    virtual ~Vector();                  // <em>clean up</em>

    float getAt(                        // <em>get an element</em>
        int index                       // <em>..which element to get</em>
    ) const;

    void setAt(                         // <em>change an element</em>
        int index,                      // <em>..which element to set</em>
        float val                       // <em>..new value for element</em>
    );

    Vector operator+(                   // <em>add, creating a new vector</em>
        const Vector &amp; right            // <em>..thing being added</em>
    );

    Vector operator*(                   // <em>multiply (create result)</em>
        const Vector &amp; right            // <em>..thing being multiplied</em>
    );

    Vector &amp; operator=(                 // <em>assign, returning target</em>
        const Vector &amp; right            // <em>..source</em>
    );

  protected :
    int len_;                           // <em>current length</em>
    float * val_;                       // <em>current values</em>
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Consider what happens when the following statement is executed:

<blockquote><pre>
Vector x, a, b, c;
// <em>variable initialization omitted</em>
x = a + b * c;
</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt>b*c</tt> creates a new <tt>Vector</tt>, and fills it with
the elementwise product of <tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt> by looping over
the values that those two vectors encapsulate.  The call to the
addition operator creates another temporary, and executes another loop
to fill it.  Finally, the call to the assignment operator doesn't
create a third temporary, but it does execute a third loop.  Thus,
this simple statement is equivalent to:

<blockquote><a name="inefficient-loops"><pre>
Vector x, a, b, c;

// <em>...initialization...</em>

Vector temp_1;
for (int i=0; i&lt;<em>vectorLength</em>; ++i)
{
    temp_1.setAt(i, b.getAt(i) * c.getAt(i));
}

Vector temp_2;
for (int i=0; i&lt;<em>vectorLength</em>; ++i)
{
    temp_2.setAt(i, a.getAt(i) + temp_1.getAt(i));
}

for (int i=0; i&lt;<em>vectorLength</em>; ++i)
{
    x.setAt(i, temp_2.getAt(i));
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Clearly, if this program was written in C instead of C++, the three
loops would have been combined, and the two temporary vectors
eliminated:

<blockquote><pre>
Vector x, a, b, c;
// <em>...initialization...</em>
for (int i=0; i&lt;<em>vectorLength</em>; ++i)
{
    x.setAt(i, a.getAt(i) + b.getAt(i) * c.getAt(i));
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The optimizations required to turn the three-loop version of this
code into its single-loop equivalent are beyond the capabilities of
existing commercial compilers.  Because operations may involve
aliasing---i.e., because an expression like <tt>x=a+b*c</tt> can
assign to a vector while also reading from it---optimizers must err on
the side of caution, and neither eliminate temporaries nor fuse loops.
This has led many programmers to believe that C++ is intrinsically
less efficient than C or Fortran&nbsp;77.

<p>Luckily, this conclusion is wrong.  By using templates in a
highly-structured way, PETE exposes opportunities for optimization to
compilers without sacrificing readability or portability.  The result
is that modern C++ compilers can deliver the same performance for
PETE-based programs as C or Fortran compilers do for equivalent
programs written in those lower-level languages.

<p>In order to understand how and why PETE does what it does, it is
necessary to understand what C++ <a href="#templates">templates</a>
are, and how PETE (and similar libraries) use templates to encode <a
href="#parsetrees">parse trees</a>.

<a name="templates"><h2>Templates</h2></a>

<p>Templates were a late addition to C++, but they have increased the
power of the language significantly.  One way to look at templates is
as an improvement over macros.  Suppose that you wanted to create a
set of classes to store pairs of <tt>int</tt>s, pairs of
<tt>float</tt>s, and so on.  Without templates, you might define a
macro:

<blockquote><pre>
#define DECLARE_PAIR_CLASS(name_, type_)                            \
class name_                                                         \
{                                                                   \
  public :                                                          \
    name_();                            // <em>default constructor      \</em>
    name_(type_ left, type_ right);     // <em>value constructor        \</em>
    name_(const name_ &amp; right);         // <em>copy constructor         \</em>
    virtual ~name_();                   // <em>destructor               \</em>
    type_ &amp; left();                     // <em>access left element      \</em>
    type_ &amp; right();                    // <em>access right element     \</em>
                                                                    \
  protected :                                                       \
    type_ left_, right_;                // <em>value storage            \</em>
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>then use it to create each class in turn:

<blockquote><pre>
DECLARE_PAIR_CLASS(IntPair, int)
DECLARE_PAIR_CLASS(FloatPair, float)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>A better way to do this is to declare a template class:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class DataType&gt;
class Pair
{
  public :
    Pair();                             // <em>default constructor</em>
    Pair(DataType left,                 // <em>value constructor</em>
         DataType right);
    Pair(const Pair&lt;DataType&gt; &amp; right);           // <em>copy constructor</em>
    virtual ~Pair();                    // <em>destructor</em>
    DataType &amp; left();                  // <em>access left element</em>
    DataType &amp; right();                 // <em>access right element</em>

  protected :
    DataType left_, right_;             // <em>value storage</em>
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The keyword <tt>template</tt> tells the compiler that the class
cannot be compiled right away, since it depends on an as-yet-unknown
data type.  When the declarations:

<blockquote><pre>
Pair&lt;int&gt;   pairOfInts;
Pair&lt;float&gt; pairOfFloats;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>are seen, the compiler instantiates <tt>Pair&lt;&gt;</tt> once for
each underlying data type.  This happens automatically: the programmer
does <em>not</em> have to create the actual pair classes explicitly by
saying:

<blockquote><pre>
typedef Pair&lt;int&gt; IntPair;              // <em>incorrect!</em>
IntPair pairOfInts;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Templates can also be used to define generic functions, as in:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class DataType&gt;
void swap(DataType &amp; left, DataType &amp; right)
{
    DataType tmp(left);
    left  = right;
    right = tmp;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once again, this function can be called with two objects of any
matching type, without any further work on the programmer's part:

<blockquote><pre>
int   i, j;
swap(i, j);

Shape back, front;
swap(back, front);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that the implementation of <tt>swap()</tt> depends on the
actual data type of its arguments having both a copy constructor (so
that <tt>tmp</tt> can be initialized with the value of <tt>left</tt>)
and an assignment operator (so that <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt>
can be overwritten).  If the actual data type does not provide either
of these, the compiler will report an error.

<p>Note also that <tt>swap()</tt> can be made more flexible by not
requiring the two objects to have exactly the same type.  The
following re-definition of <tt>swap()</tt> will exchange the values of
any two objects, provided appropriate assignment and conversion
operators exist:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class LeftType, class RightType&gt;
void swap(LeftType &amp; left, RightType &amp; right)
{
    LeftType tmp(left);
    left  = right;
    right = tmp;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Finally, the word <tt>class</tt> appears in template definitions
because other values, such as integers, can also be used.  The code
below defines a small fixed-size vector class, but does not fix either
its size or underlying data type:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class DataType, int FixedSize&gt;
class FixedVector
{
  public :
    FixedVector();                      // <em>default constructor</em>
    FixedVector(DataType filler);       // <em>value constructor</em>
    virtual ~FixedVector();             // <em>destructor</em>

    FixedVector(                        // <em>copy constructor</em>
        FixedVector&lt;DataType, FixedSize&gt; right
    );

    FixedVector&lt;DataType&gt;               // <em>assignment</em>
    operator=(
        const FixedVector&lt;DataType, FixedSize&gt; &amp; right
    );

    DataType &amp; operator[](int index);   // <em>element access</em>

  protected :
    DataType storage[FixedSize];        // <em>fixed-size storage</em>
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is at this point that the possible <a
name="performance-advantages">performance advantages</a> of templated
classes start to become apparent.  Suppose that the copy constructor
for this class is implemented as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class DataType, int FixedSize&gt;
FixedVector::FixedVector(
    FixedVector&lt;DataType, FixedSize&gt; right
){
    for (int i=0; i&lt;FixedSize; ++i)
    {
        storage[i] = right.storage[i];
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>When the compiler sees a use of the copy constructor, such as:

<blockquote><pre>
FixedVector&lt;DataType, FixedSize&gt; first;
// <em>initialization of first vector omitted</em>
FixedVector&lt;DataType, FixedSize&gt; second(first);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>it knows the size as well as the underlying data type of the
objects being manipulated, and can therefore do more optimization than
it could if the size was variable.

<p>Automatic instantiation of templates is convenient and powerful,
but does have one drawback.  Suppose the <tt>Pair&lt;&gt;</tt> class
shown earlier is instantiated in one source file to create a pair of
<tt>int</tt>s, and in another source file to create a pair of
<tt>Shape</tt>s.  The compiler and linker could:

<ol>

<li>treat the two instantiations as completely separate classes;

<li>detect and eliminate redundant instantiations; or

<li>avoid redundancy by not instantiating templates until the program as
a whole was being linked.

</ol>

<p>The first of these can lead to very large programs, as a
commonly-used template class may be expanded dozens of times.  The
second is difficult to do, as it involves patching up compiled files
as they are being linked.  Most recent versions of C++ compilers are
therefore taking the third approach, but POOMA&nbsp;II users should be
aware that older versions might still produce much larger executables
than one would expect.

<p>The last use of templates that is important to this discussion is
template methods.  Just as templated functions are instantiated for
different types of arguments, so too are templated methods
instantiated for a class when and as they are used.  Suppose a class
called <tt>Example</tt> is defined as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
class Example
{
  public :
    Example();                          // <em>default constructor</em>
    virtual ~Example();                 // <em>destructor</em>

    template&lt;class T&gt;
    void foo(T object)
    {
        // <em>some operation on object</em>
    }
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Whenever the method <tt>Example::foo()</tt> is called with an
object of a particular type, the compiler instantiates it for that
type.  Thus, both of the following calls are legal:

<blockquote><pre>
Example e;
Shape box;
e.foo(5);                               // <em>instantiate for int</em>
e.foo(box);                             // <em>instantiate for Shape</em>
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="parsetrees"><h2>Representing Parse Trees</h2></a>

<p>Parse trees are commonly used by compilers to store the essential
features of the source of a program.  The leaf nodes of a parse tree
consist of atomic symbols in the language, such as variable names or
numerical constants.  The parse tree's intermediate nodes represent
ways of combining those values, such as arithmetic operators and
<tt>while</tt> loops.  For example, the expression <tt>-B + 2 * C</tt>
could be represented by the parse tree shown in <a
href="#fig-simple-parse-tree">Figure&nbsp;1</a>

<center><table>
<tr><td align=center><img src="tree.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>Figure 1: A Simple Parse Tree</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Parse trees are often represented textually using prefix notation,
in which the non-terminal combiner and its arguments are strung
together in a parenthesized list.  For example, the expression
<tt>-B + 2 * C</tt> can be represented as
<tt>(+&nbsp;(-&nbsp;B)&nbsp;(*&nbsp;2&nbsp;C))</tt>.

<p>What makes all of this relevant to high-performance computing is
that the expression <tt>(+&nbsp;(-&nbsp;B)&nbsp;(*&nbsp;2&nbsp;C))</tt> could
equally easily be written
<tt>BinaryOp&lt;Add,&nbsp;UnaryOp&lt;Minus,&nbsp;B&gt;,&nbsp;BinaryOp&lt;Multiply,&nbsp;Scalar&lt;2&gt;,&nbsp;C&gt;&gt;</tt>:
it's just a different notation.  However, this notation is very
similar to the syntax of C++ templates --- so similar, in fact, that
it can actually be implemented given a careful enough set of template
definitions.  As discussed <a
href="#performance-advantages">earlier</a>, by providing more
information to the optimizer as programs are being compiled, template
libraries can increase the scope for performance optimization.

<p>Any facility for representing expressions as trees must provide:

<ul>

<li>a representation for leaf nodes (operands);

<li>a way to represent operations to be performed at the leaves
(i.e. functions on individual operands);

<li>a representation for non-leaf nodes (operators);

<li>a way to represent operations to be performed at non-leaf nodes
(i.e. combiners);

<li>a way to pass information (such as the function to be performed at
the leaves) downward in the tree; and

<li>a way to collect and combine information moving up the tree.

</ul>

<p>C++ templates were not designed with these requirements in mind,
but it turns out that they can satisfy them.  The central idea is to
use the compiler's representation of type information in an
instantiated template to store operands and operators.  For example,
suppose that a set of classes have been defined to represent the basic
arithmetic operations:

<blockquote><pre>
struct AddOp
{
    static inline double apply(const double &amp; left, const double &amp; y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
};

struct MulOp
{
    static inline double apply(const double &amp; left, const double &amp; y)
    {
        return x * y;
    }
};

// <em>...and so on...</em>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note the use of the keyword <tt>struct</tt>; this simply signals
that everything else in these classes---in particular, their
default constructors and their destructors---are <tt>public</tt>.

<p>Now suppose that a templated class <tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> has
been defined as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Operator, class RHS&gt;
class BinaryOp
{
  public :
    // <em>empty constructor will be optimized away, but triggers</em>
    // <em>type identification needed for template expansion</em>
    BinaryOp(
        Operator op,
        const Vector &amp; leftArg,
        const RHS    &amp; rightArg
    ) : left_(leftArg),
        right_(rightArg)
    {}

    // <em>empty destructor will be optimized away</em>
    ~BinaryOp()
    {}

    // <em>calculate value of expression at specified index by recursing</em>
    inline double apply(int i)
    {
        return Operator::apply(leftArg.apply(i), rightArg.apply(i));
    }

  protected :
    const Vector &amp; left_;
    const RHS    &amp; right_;
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If <tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt> have been defined as <tt>Vector</tt>,
and if <tt>Vector::apply()</tt> returns the vector element at the
specified index, then when the compiler sees the following expression:

<blockquote><pre>
BinaryOp&lt;MulOp, Vector, Vector&gt;(MulOp(), b, c).apply(3)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>it translates the expression into
<tt>b.apply(3)&nbsp;*&nbsp;c.apply(3)</tt>.  The creation of the
intermediate instance of <tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> is optimized away
completely, since all that object does is record a couple of
references to arguments.

<p>Why to go all this trouble?  The answer is rather long, and
requires a few seemingly-pointless steps.  Consider what happens when
the complicated expression above is nested inside an even more
complicated expression, which adds an element of another vector
<tt>a</tt> to the original expression's result:

<blockquote><pre>
BinaryOp&lt; AddOp,
          Vector,
          BinaryOp&lt; MulOp, Vector, Vector &gt;
        &gt;(a, BinaryOp&lt; MulOp, Vector, Vector &gt;(b, c)).apply(3);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This expression calculates
<tt>a.apply(3)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(b.apply(3)&nbsp;*c.apply(3))</tt>.  If the
expression was wrapped in a <tt>for</tt> loop, and the loop's index
was used in place of the constant <tt>3</tt>, the expression would
calculate an entire vector's worth of new values:

<blockquote><pre>
BinaryOp&lt; AddOp,
          Vector,
          BinaryOp&lt; MulOp, Vector, Vector &gt; &gt;
        expr(a, BinaryOp&lt; MulOp, Vector, Vector &gt;(b, c));
for (int i=0; i<<em>vectorLength</em>; ++i)
{
  double tmp = expr.apply(i);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The possible nesting of <tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> inside itself is
the reason that the <tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> template has two type
parameters.  The first argument to a <tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> is
always a <tt>Vector</tt>, but the second may be either a
<tt>Vector</tt> or an expression involving <tt>Vector</tt>s.

<p>The code above is not something any reasonable person would want to
write.  However, having a compiler create this loop and its contained
expression automatically is entirely plausible.  The first step is to
overload addition and multiplication for vectors, so that
<tt>operator+(Vector,Vector)</tt> (and
<tt>operator*(Vector,Vector)</tt>) instantiates
<tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> with <tt>AddOp</tt> (and <tt>MulOp</tt>) as
its first type argument, and invokes the <tt>apply()</tt> method of
the instantiated object.  The second step is to overload the
assignment operator <tt>operator=(Vector,Vector)</tt> so that it
generates the loop shown above:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Op, T&gt;
Vector &amp operator=(
    Vector &amp; target,
    BinaryOp&lt;Op&gt; &amp; expr
){
    for (int i=0; i&lt;<em>vectorLength</em>; ++i)
    {
        target.set(i, expr.apply(i));
    }
    return target;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>With these operator definitions in play, the simple expression:

<blockquote><pre>
Vector x, a, b, c;
// <em>...initialization...</em>
x = a + b * c;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>is automatically translated into the efficient loop shown above,
rather than into the <a href="#inefficient-loops">inefficient
loops</a> shown earlier.  The expression on the right hand side is
turned into an instance of a templated class whose type encodes the
operations to be performed, while the implementation of the assignment
operator causes that expression to be evaluated exactly once for each
legal index.  No temporaries are created, and only a single loop is
executed.

<a name="lookahead"><h2>Looking Ahead</h2></a>

<p>Of course, an industrial-strength implementation of these ideas
requires definitions that are considerably more complicated than the
ones shown in the previous section.  For a start,
<tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> and its kin are not defined directly on any
one class <tt>Vector</tt>.  It isn't even defined for
<tt>Vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>, but rather for a wrapper class
<em>UNDONE</em>.  This class expects nothing from its contained class
except an <tt>apply</tt> method capable of turning an index into a
value.  This allows users to integrate their own classes with PETE
simply by providing the required method.  Similarly, the classes that
PETE defines to represent unary and binary operators are considerably
more flexible than the ones shown above.

<p>One of the idioms used by PETE that hasn't been shown above is the
<em>tag class</em>.  A tag class has no methods, and contains no data;
its only reason for existing is as a flag to the C++ compiler during
template expansion.  A mutually exclusive set of tag classes is
therefore the compile-time equivalent of an enumeration.  PETE uses
tag classes to identify operators, the way in which operands are
referenced (i.e. directly or through iterators and other
intermediators), and so on.

<p>Another idiom used in PETE is the traits class, which depends on a
feature of ANSI C++ called partial specialization.  When a C++
compiler instantiates a template, it tries to choose the best possible
match for the arguments it is given.  For example, suppose that both
of the following definitions are in scope when the objects
<tt>fred</tt> and <tt>jane</tt> are created:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
class Example
{
    enum { tag = 123; }
};

template&lt;&gt;
class Example&lt;int&gt;
{
    enum { tag = 456; }
};

Example&lt;int&gt;   fred;
Example&lt;float&gt; jane;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As you would expect, <tt>fred</tt>'s <tt>tag</tt> has the value
456, while <tt>jane</tt>'s has the generic value 123: the compiler
chooses the most specific type possible.

<p>This facility can be used to create lookup tables.  For example,
suppose we want to encode the types of the results of arithmetic
operations involving an arbitrary mix of <tt>int</tt> and
<tt>double</tt> arguments.  The following definitions do the trick:

<blockquote><pre>
// <em>generic case</em>
template&lt;class Left, class Right&gt;
class TypeEncoding
{
    // <em>empty: no generic result possible</em>
};

// <em>int op int => int</em>
template&lt;&gt;
class TypeEncoding&lt;int, int&gt;
{
    typedef int Result_t;
};

// <em>int op double => double</em>
template&lt;&gt;
class TypeEncoding&lt;int, double&gt;
{
    typedef double Result_t;
};

// <em>double op int => double</em>
template&lt;&gt;
class TypeEncoding&lt;double, int&gt;
{
    typedef double Result_t;
};

// <em>double op double => double</em>
template&lt;&gt;
class TypeEncoding&lt;double, double&gt;
{
    typedef double Result_t;
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>We can now overcome one of the biggest shortcomings of C++
templates, and automatically generate the correct result type of a
templated expression:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Left, class Right&gt;
TypeEncoding&lt;Left, Right&gt;::Result_t
add(const Left &amp; left, const Right &amp; right)
{
    return left + right;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If <tt>add()</tt> is called with two <tt>int</tt> arguments, the
compiler will know that that particular instantiation is going to
return an <tt>int</tt>.  If it is called with one or two
<tt>double</tt> arguments, the compiler will know it is going to
return a <tt>double</tt>.  By specializing
<tt>TypeEncoding&lt;&gt;</tt> for other mixes of types, a library like
PETE can tell the compiler the result type of any expression over any
mix of types.  In particular, if a new class such as <tt>Complex</tt>,
<tt>Quaternion</tt>, or <tt>Color</tt> is added, the compiler can be
told what the result of (for example) multiplying a <tt>Color</tt> by
a <tt>float</tt> is, without anything else in the library having to be
changed.

<p><tt>TypeEncoding&lt;&gt;</tt> is an example of a traits class.
Each specialization of the class defines a <tt>typedef</tt> with a
particular name (in this case, <tt>Result_t</tt>).  The class designer
could also specify that <tt>TypeEncoding&lt;&gt;</tt>'s
specializations had to define such things as constant strings:

<blockquote><pre>
// <em>int op double => double</em>
template&lt;&gt;
class TypeEncoding&lt;int, double&gt;
{
    typedef double Result_t;

    static const char * const Signature = "{int,double}=>double";
};

// <em>other classes contain similar definitions</em>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>to help programs print debugging information:

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Left, class Right&gt;
TypeEncoding&lt;Left, Right&gt;::Result_t
add(const Left &amp; left, const Right &amp; right)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; TypeEncoding&lt;Left, Right&gt;::Signature &lt;&lt; endl;
    return left + right;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In general, if the classes in the set associated with a trait all
adhere to some conventions regarding name definitions, then traits
classes can be used to implement compile-time polymorphism.  Another
way to think of this is that each class in a set of traits classes
provides different set of answers to a pre-defined set of questions.

<p>Since writing a dozen or more specializations of classes like
<tt>TypeEncoding&lt;&gt;</tt> and <tt>BinaryOp&lt;&gt;</tt> by hand
would be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone, PETE provides some
simple command-line tools that can generate the required C++ code
automatically.  The <a href="tut-1.html">first tutorial</a> shows how
to use these tools to integrate a simple 3-element vector class into
PETE.  Subsequent tutorials show the steps required to integrate more
complex classes, such as the vectors and lists of the <a
href="stl.html">Standard Template Library</a> (STL), and how to
provide additional operators and combiners.
