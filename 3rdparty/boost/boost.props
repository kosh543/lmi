            Boost auto-linking uses ugly library names and is impossible to
            configure as defining BOOST_AUTO_LINK_NOMANGLE only works once (!)
            as it gets undefined by boost/config/auto_link.hpp, so for the
            files including both regex and filesystem headers, it only applies
            to the first library, but not the second one. Just disable it
            completely instead of dealing with this madness and link with
            the filesystem from here and with the regex one from the only
            project which needs it.
